# v0.1.1 - Performance & DNSSEC Improvements

## ðŸš€ Performance Improvements
- **NS Caching**: Added smart caching for authoritative nameserver lookups - eliminates redundant DNS queries and prevents loading indicator flashing
- **Cache Busting**: Press `r` to refresh and clear all caches for fresh data
- **Faster Loading**: Reduced HTTP/HTTPS timeouts from 10s to 5s
- **Faster Certificate Checks**: Optimized OpenSSL certificate validation (~17s â†’ ~8s per domain)
  - Removed slow TLS version probing, cipher suite detection, and OCSP checks
  - Improved timeout handling for unresponsive hosts

## ðŸ”’ DNSSEC Fixes
- **Accurate Validation**: Now correctly detects mismatched DS/DNSKEY records (broken DNSSEC chains show as BOGUS instead of SECURE)
- **Parent Zone Queries**: DS records are now queried from the correct parent zone's authoritative nameservers
- **Better Visualization**: Fixed dangling connection lines in DNSSEC chain visualization
- **Neutral RRSIG Indicator**: Changed RRSIG presence from positive indicator to neutral observation

## ðŸ§¹ Codebase Improvements
- **Simplified DNS Stack**: Removed dog adapter - now uses dig exclusively for better compatibility
- **Cleaner Code**: Removed unnecessary progress callbacks that caused UI flashing

## ðŸ“¦ Download
